# Progress Log - Friends Radar

## Iteration 0 - Initial Setup (Manual)
- Project created with Vite + Vue 3 + TypeScript
- Ralph loop structure initialized
- All development tooling in place

### Learnings
- Use `npm run build` to verify TypeScript compilation
- Keep stories small - one component or one feature per story

---

## Feature Planning - Core Friends Radar (Manual)
- Feature spec created: `specs/core-friends-radar.md`
- Visual mockup provided showing traffic-light style friend tiles
- PRD created with 9 user stories broken down for Ralph loop

### Feature Overview
- Store friends with first names
- Persist to localStorage
- Display as tile grid with color indicators
- Green (0-7 days) → Yellow (7-21 days) → Red (21+ days)
- Click to record contact (reset to green)

### Stories Ready for Implementation
1. US-001: Friend data model and types
2. US-002: localStorage persistence
3. US-003: Color calculation utility
4. US-004: FriendTile component
5. US-005: FriendsGrid component
6. US-006: AddFriendForm component
7. US-007: App.vue integration
8. US-008: Delete friend functionality
9. US-009: Polish styling

## Iteration 1 - 2026-01-28
- Story: US-001 - Create Friend data model and types
- Status: Completed
- Changes: 
  - Created Friend interface in src/types/Friend.ts (id, name, lastContact)
  - Created useFriends composable in src/composables/useFriends.ts
  - Composable provides reactive friends ref and addFriend, removeFriend, updateLastContact functions
  - Used crypto.randomUUID() for unique IDs
  - npm run build passes successfully

### Learnings
- Project structure: src/types/ for interfaces, src/composables/ for Vue composables
- crypto.randomUUID() is available in modern browsers for ID generation
- Composable follows Vue 3 Composition API pattern with shared reactive state

### Next Up
- US-002: localStorage persistence layer

---

## Iteration 2 - 2026-01-28
- Story: US-002 - Implement localStorage persistence
- Status: Completed
- Changes:
  - Added loadFriends() function to load from localStorage on init
  - Added saveFriends() function to save to localStorage
  - Used Vue's watch() with deep: true to auto-save on any change
  - Storage key: 'friends-radar-data'
  - Try-catch blocks handle invalid JSON and storage errors gracefully
  - npm run build passes successfully

### Learnings
- Vue's watch with { deep: true } tracks nested array changes automatically
- localStorage persistence pattern: load on init, watch for changes to save
- Always handle localStorage errors (quota exceeded, JSON parse errors, etc.)

### Next Up
- US-003: Color calculation utility

---

## Iteration 3 - 2026-01-28
- Story: US-003 - Create color calculation utility
- Status: Completed
- Changes:
  - Created src/utils/colorUtils.ts with getContactColor function
  - Function calculates days since last contact and returns appropriate color
  - Green: 0-7 days, Yellow: 7-21 days, Red: 21+ days
  - Exported ContactColor type for type safety
  - Used clear constants for thresholds (GREEN_THRESHOLD_DAYS, YELLOW_THRESHOLD_DAYS)
  - npm run build passes successfully

### Learnings
- Utility functions should be in src/utils/ directory
- Export types alongside functions for better TypeScript experience
- Use clear constant names for magic numbers (thresholds)
- Document function purpose and parameters with JSDoc comments

### Next Up
- US-004: FriendTile component

---

## Iteration 4 - 2026-01-28
- Story: US-004 - Create FriendTile component
- Status: Completed
- Changes:
  - Created FriendTile.vue component in src/components/
  - Accepts Friend prop with TypeScript type checking
  - Displays circular color indicator (80px diameter)
  - Uses getContactColor utility via computed property
  - Emits 'contact' event with friend ID on click
  - Styled with hover/active states and glowing effects
  - Added demo to App.vue showing all three colors (green/yellow/red)
  - npm run build passes successfully

### Learnings
- Vue 3 Composition API with <script setup> makes components very clean
- computed() is ideal for derived values like color
- Scoped CSS isolates component styles
- CSS transitions on transform create smooth hover effects
- box-shadow with color opacity creates nice glow effects

### Next Up
- US-005: FriendsGrid component

---

## Iteration 5 - 2026-01-28
- Story: US-005 - Create FriendsGrid component
- Status: Completed
- Changes:
  - Created FriendsGrid.vue component in src/components/
  - Accepts friends prop (Friend array) with TypeScript types
  - Uses CSS Grid: 4 columns on desktop, 2 columns on mobile
  - Renders FriendTile for each friend with proper key binding
  - Forwards contact events from child FriendTile components
  - Shows empty state message when friends array is empty
  - Refactored App.vue to use FriendsGrid instead of inline grid
  - Removed duplicate grid CSS from App.vue
  - Fixed TypeScript error with array access safety check
  - npm run build passes successfully

### Learnings
- Component composition: FriendsGrid contains FriendTiles
- Event forwarding pattern: child emits → parent emits → grandparent handles
- :deep() selector in Vue scoped CSS for styling nested components
- v-if/v-else for conditional rendering (empty state vs grid)
- TypeScript array access safety: check undefined before using index

### Next Up
- US-006: AddFriendForm component

---

## Iteration 6 - 2026-01-28
- Story: US-006 - Create AddFriendForm component
- Status: Completed
- Changes:
  - Created AddFriendForm.vue component in src/components/
  - Text input with placeholder "Enter friend's name"
  - Add Friend button that submits the form
  - Form validation: button disabled when name is empty
  - Trims whitespace before submission
  - Emits 'add' event with friend name (string)
  - Clears input field after successful submission
  - Supports Enter key submission via @submit.prevent
  - Max length 50 characters for friend names
  - Responsive: stacks vertically on mobile (<768px)
  - Integrated into App.vue with handleAddFriend handler
  - Green color scheme matching app theme
  - Smooth hover/focus states with transitions
  - npm run build passes successfully

### Learnings
- Form handling in Vue: @submit.prevent for custom submit logic
- v-model two-way binding for input fields
- Computed disabled state based on trimmed value
- :disabled attribute binding for button states
- CSS flex layout with gap for form elements
- Mobile-first responsive: flex-direction: column on small screens
- Input focus states with border-color transitions
- Disabled button styling (opacity, cursor: not-allowed)

### Next Up
- US-007: Full App.vue integration (wire everything together)
